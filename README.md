# GD-Decompiled
an attempt to get the source code for Geometry Dash 2.11 through reverse engineering and decompiling the game

!!! this is a fork and my unofficial continuation to wylie's https://github.com/Wyliemaster/GD-Decompiled.

### info
this is not a 100% accurate decompilation, more like a code representation
this is an android armeabiv7 2.111 decomp
this code may be and is not compilable as its just a guide on how the game works
